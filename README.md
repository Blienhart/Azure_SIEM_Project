# Azure_SIEM_Project
This is not so much as a repository as it is a guide; in this walkthrough, we will setup a Azure Si Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live, public facing virtual machine for the sake of monitoring and preventing any threat actors. The goal of this is to get a feel for what type of skills and tools you would use in a SoC analyst role.
